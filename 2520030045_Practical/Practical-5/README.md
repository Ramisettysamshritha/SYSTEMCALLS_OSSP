# Operating Systems Lab – Practical 5

## Aim

To implement a Producer–Consumer communication system using anonymous pipes and to execute the equivalent shell command `ls -l | grep ".c"` using `fork()`, `pipe()`, `dup2()`, and `exec()`.

---

## Programs Included

### 1. producer_consumer.c
Implements communication between a parent (producer) and child (consumer) using an anonymous pipe.

### 2. pipe_exec.c
Implements the shell pipeline `ls -l | grep ".c"` using Linux system calls.

---

## Compilation and Execution

### Producer–Consumer

```bash
nano producer_consumer.c
gcc producer_consumer.c
./a.out
```

### Shell Pipeline

```bash
nano pipe_exec.c
gcc pipe_exec.c
./a.out
```

---

## Description

### Producer–Consumer using Anonymous Pipe

- The parent process acts as the producer.
- The child process acts as the consumer.
- Data is transferred through an anonymous pipe using `write()` and `read()`.
- Communication time is measured to observe IPC efficiency.

### Shell Command Implementation

The program executes the equivalent of:

```bash
ls -l | grep ".c"
```

- `pipe()` creates a communication channel.
- `fork()` creates child processes.
- `dup2()` redirects standard input and output.
- `exec()` replaces the child processes with `ls` and `grep`.

---

## System Calls Used

- `fork()`
- `pipe()`
- `dup2()`
- `read()`
- `write()`
- `exec()`
- `wait()`

---

## Outcome

- Successfully implemented Producer–Consumer communication using anonymous pipes.
- Measured inter-process communication efficiency.
- Successfully executed the shell pipeline using `fork()`, `pipe()`, `dup2()`, and `exec()`.
