# Operating Systems Lab – Practical 4

## Aim

To create multiple child processes using `fork()` and synchronize them using `wait()` and `waitpid()`. To create a zombie process, observe it in the process table, and eliminate it using proper synchronization.

---

## Programs Included

### 1. wait_compare.c
Creates multiple child processes and demonstrates the difference between `wait()` and `waitpid()`.

### 2. zombie.c
Creates a zombie process by allowing the child process to terminate while the parent delays calling `wait()`.

### 3. no_zombie.c
Eliminates the zombie process using proper synchronization with `wait()`.

---

## Compilation and Execution

### wait() and waitpid()

```bash
nano wait_compare.c
gcc wait_compare.c
./a.out
```

### Zombie Process

```bash
nano zombie.c
gcc zombie.c
./a.out
```

### Remove Zombie Process

```bash
nano no_zombie.c
gcc no_zombie.c
./a.out
```

### View Zombie Process

```bash
ps -el | grep Z
```

---

## Description

### Process Synchronization

- The parent creates multiple child processes using `fork()`.
- `wait()` waits for any child process to terminate.
- `waitpid()` waits for a specific child process using its PID.
- Both methods synchronize the parent and child processes.

### Zombie Process

- The child process terminates immediately.
- The parent remains active without collecting the child's exit status.
- The terminated child appears as a zombie (`Z`) in the process table.

### Removing the Zombie

- The parent calls `wait()`.
- The child's exit status is collected.
- The zombie entry is removed from the process table.

---

## System Calls Used

- `fork()`
- `wait()`
- `waitpid()`
- `sleep()`
- `exit()`
- `getpid()`

---

## Outcome

- Successfully implemented process synchronization using `wait()` and `waitpid()`.
- Created and observed a zombie process.
- Eliminated the zombie process using proper synchronization.
