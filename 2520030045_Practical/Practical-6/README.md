# Operating Systems Lab – Practical 6

## Aim

To implement inter-process communication using Named Pipes (FIFOs) in a client–server model and to demonstrate asynchronous event handling using POSIX signal handlers.

---

## Programs Included

### 1. serverp6.c
The server creates named pipes (FIFOs), receives messages from the client, processes them, and sends a response back through another FIFO.

### 2. clientp6.c
The client accepts a message from the user, sends it to the server through the FIFO, and displays the reply received from the server.

### 3. signal_handler.c
This program captures the POSIX signals `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and `SIGUSR1` using signal handlers and demonstrates asynchronous event handling.

---

## Compilation and Execution

### FIFO Server

```bash
nano serverp6.c
gcc serverp6.c
./a.out
```

### FIFO Client

```bash
nano clientp6.c
gcc clientp6.c
./a.out
```

### POSIX Signal Handling

```bash
nano signal_handler.c
gcc signal_handler.c
./a.out
```

## Description

### Named Pipe (FIFO) Communication

- The server creates two named pipes using `mkfifo()`.
- The client writes a message into the first FIFO.
- The server reads the message, processes it, and appends a confirmation string.
- The modified message is sent back to the client through the second FIFO.
- This demonstrates full-duplex communication between two independent processes.

### FIFO Behavior with Multiple Clients

- Multiple clients can communicate with the same server using the FIFO.
- Messages are delivered in the order they are written.
- The server processes one request at a time, ensuring sequential communication.
- FIFOs provide reliable inter-process communication between unrelated processes.

### POSIX Signal Handling

The program registers signal handlers using the `signal()` system call.

- **SIGINT** – Generated when the user presses `Ctrl + C`; the handler captures the interrupt signal.
- **SIGTERM** – Sent using the `kill` command to terminate the process gracefully.
- **SIGUSR1** – A user-defined signal used for custom asynchronous events.

Signal handlers allow the process to respond immediately whenever a signal is received without continuously checking for events.

## System Calls Used

- `mkfifo()`
- `open()`
- `read()`
- `write()`
- `close()`
- `fork()`
- `signal()`
- `kill()`
- `getpid()`

## Outcome

- Successfully implemented a client–server communication system using Named Pipes (FIFOs).
- Demonstrated message exchange between client and server.
- Observed FIFO behavior during communication.
- Successfully captured and handled `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and `SIGUSR1`.
- Demonstrated asynchronous event handling using POSIX signal handlers.
